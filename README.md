# individual-1
chrome extension to redact the name of individual-1

## installation instructions
Sorry everyone, I did not want to pay the $5 to put this in the chrome webstore; so you'll have to install this manually but it is easy

1. Download this repository. In the upper right corner there is a green button that says 'clone or download'. Click on that and select download zip.
2. Unzip the file you just downloaded
3. Open chrome and type 'chrome://extensions/' in your browser bar
4. In the upper right corner turn on developer mode (this allows you to install extensions manually)
5. Now in the upper left you can select 'load unpacked'
6. Navigate to the folder you unzipped and select it.

You should be all set to go. You can return to chrome://extensions to uninstall or disable it. Enjoy!!
